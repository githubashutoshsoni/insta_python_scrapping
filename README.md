a simple script to follow and like a few posts based on hashtags you follow...
just type your hashtags in 

```
hashtag_list = ['first_tag','second_tag', 'third_tag', 'fourth_tag']
```
sit back and brew a coffee. 

P.S. I'm not responsible for instagram blocking your account(it did mine temporary for a few days)...
